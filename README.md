<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project 
[Back to top](#table-of-contents)
[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://finstagram-project.herokuapp.com/)

Instagram is a well known website with a lot of interesting social media aspects, which presented challenges with redux state and database relationships. It was a good opportunity to show our ability to create a full stack website built after one of the most popular websites in the world.

### Built With

## Interesting Issues:
### Redux Interactions With Follow State
[Back to top](#table-of-contents) 

<b>Issue</b>: The explore page was based on a slice of state that held all of the user's posts of users that the current session user did not follow, while the feed page was based on a separate slice that held all of the user's posts of users that the session user <i>does</i> follow. This created an issue when following a user on the explore page, as the website would crash because it would be looking for a user in the non-followed user's posts slice after that user had been moved out of that redux slice of state. A similar issue would happen on the feed page when unfollowing a user.

<b>Solution</b>: A new slice of state had to be made that held all users that both the explore and feed pages depended their views on. That way, whether a user was being followed or not, their movement between the followed users slice of state and the non-followed users slice of state did not affect the rendering of each page. This taught us the importance of not only thinking of ways to organize redux state, but how information would be moved between slices of state based on user interaction. In the future, it is important to think of how state is malleable, and how to defensively code against changes in state.

### Coordinating Feature Implementation With Multiple Collaborators
[Back to top](#table-of-contents) 

<b>Issue</b>: Though it may seem simple, having multiple people work on a project in tandem created some interesting challenges when it came to maximizing the efficiency of our coding, while preventing each of us from stepping on the others toes when it comes to editing the same files.

<b>Solution</b>: Constant communication and planning helped us stay efficient so that we could each work on a separate feature of the website, and when we had to work on the same files/features, talking out how to organize merge conflicts helped enormously so that we could keep the ball rolling on coding out the project.<b>Issue</b>:

## Features to Implement Next
### Loading Time Efficiency
[Back to top](#table-of-contents)

<b>Issue</b>: As more posts, comments, likes, and users get added to the database, the amount of time it takes for the website to store new likes and comments and render that change on the frontend increases.

<b>How I would do it</b>: Currently, the redux thunk that adds these entities wait for the database to be updated before updating the redux store. The best solution would be to key into the specific post that is being liked/commented on, and change the redux store in parallel to the fetch to the database. That way, a user can see the result of their action immediately, instead of waiting for the database update to complete.

<!-- # Flask React Project

This is the starter for the Flask React project.

## Getting started

1. Clone this repository (only this branch)

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/appacademy-starters/python-project-starter.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies

      ```bash
      pipenv install --dev -r dev-requirements.txt && pipenv install -r requirements.txt
      ```

3. Create a **.env** file based on the example with proper settings for your
   development environment
4. Setup your PostgreSQL user, password and database and make sure it matches your **.env** file

5. Get into your pipenv, migrate your database, seed your database, and run your flask app

   ```bash
   pipenv shell
   ```

   ```bash
   flask db upgrade
   ```

   ```bash
   flask seed all
   ```

   ```bash
   flask run
   ```

6. To run the React App in development, checkout the [README](./react-app/README.md) inside the `react-app` directory.

***
*IMPORTANT!*
   If you add any python dependencies to your pipfiles, you'll need to regenerate your requirements.txt before deployment.
   You can do this by running:

   ```bash
   pipenv lock -r > requirements.txt
   ```

*ALSO IMPORTANT!*
   psycopg2-binary MUST remain a dev dependency because you can't install it on apline-linux.
   There is a layer in the Dockerfile that will install psycopg2 (not binary) for us.
***

## Deploy to Heroku

1. Before you deploy, don't forget to run the following command in order to
ensure that your production environment has all of your up-to-date
dependencies. You only have to run this command when you have installed new
Python packages since your last deployment, but if you aren't sure, it won't
hurt to run it again.

   ```bash
   pipenv lock -r > requirements.txt
   ```

2. Create a new project on Heroku
3. Under Resources click "Find more add-ons" and add the add on called "Heroku Postgres"
4. Install the [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-command-line)
5. Run

   ```bash
   heroku login
   ```

6. Login to the heroku container registry

   ```bash
   heroku container:login
   ```

7. Update the `REACT_APP_BASE_URL` variable in the Dockerfile.
   This should be the full URL of your Heroku app: i.e. "https://flask-react-aa.herokuapp.com"
8. Push your docker container to heroku from the root directory of your project.
   (If you are using an M1 mac, follow [these steps below](#for-m1-mac-users) instead, then continue on to step 9.)
   This will build the Dockerfile and push the image to your heroku container registry.

   ```bash
   heroku container:push web -a {NAME_OF_HEROKU_APP}
   ```

9. Release your docker container to heroku

      ```bash
      heroku container:release web -a {NAME_OF_HEROKU_APP}
      ```

10. set up your database

      ```bash
      heroku run -a {NAME_OF_HEROKU_APP} flask db upgrade
      heroku run -a {NAME_OF_HEROKU_APP} flask seed all
      ```

11. Under Settings find "Config Vars" and add any additional/secret .env
variables.

12. profit

### For M1 Mac users

(Replaces **Step 8**)

1. Build image with linux platform for heroku servers. Replace
{NAME_OF_HEROKU_APP} with your own tag:

   ```bash=
   docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64 -t {NAME_OF_HEROKU_APP} .
   ```

2. Tag your app with the url for your apps registry. Make sure to use the name
of your Heroku app in the url and tag name:

   ```bash=2
   docker tag {NAME_OF_HEROKU_APP} registry.heroku.com/{NAME_OF_HEROKU_APP}/web
   ```

3. Use docker to push the image to the Heroku container registry:

   ```bash=3
   docker push registry.heroku.com/{NAME_OF_HEROKU_APP}/web
   ``` -->
